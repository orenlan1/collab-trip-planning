 Before generating any code, follow all guidelines:

 - SOLID, DRY, KISS, YAGNI.
 - Clean Architecture (controllers -> services -> repositories).
 - No business logic in controllers.
 - TypeScript strict mode, no any, explicit return types.
 - Input validation, secure defaults, proper error handling.
 - No redundant abstractions; readable naming.
 - Only write comments where necessary for clarity.
 - Code must be production-ready.
